# Data Visualization with Python: Constellations

This project demonstrates using the Matplotlib Python module to visualize data. This project consists of two files:

* constellation.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook provided to me by Codecademy which I have modified as per their instructions.
* constellation.py - The downloaded Python file from the notebook.

I mostly followed the base instructions but I did do a few enhancements:
* 2D Visualization
** I added color to both the background and the plot points. Initially I randomized the colors but then I opted to show white dots on a night blue background.
** The scatter points vary in size based on the z value.
** A figsize was specified to make the graph larger.
** A title has been added to the graph.
* 3D Visualization
** As with the previous graph, I changed the colors. This time I used a light gray background to allow the axes to be visible.
** A figsize was specified, and a title was provided.
